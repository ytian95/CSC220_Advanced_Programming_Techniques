Project 4

A canvas with a customizeable background made up of draggable custom shapes.

I have tried to separate the Pointer and DragableElement class functionalities 
as best as I could. However, I feel that it has made the code more "bulky" in
the sense that what I have written can be accomplished in fewer lines, such as
in my previous commit.

Final commit time: 11:00pm, 10/8/15
